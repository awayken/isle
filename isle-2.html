      <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><span
 style="font-size: 40px; color: green;">always found</span> myself in
that Isle. "Isle" is the word that the grocery manager used to replace
"Aisle" because he thought it was clever. They called this one
"Paradise Isle". I guess it was a running joke or a cute campaign to
sell the product. It worked on the majority, on the flock, but I had
never purchased one. The products they sold in Paradise Isle looked
just like the other products in the grocery store. Some were cans, some
were boxes, some were abnormally shaped packages. You could look at
them and say, "That would be Mountain Dew" or "That is definately Tide."</p>

      <td colspan="2">
      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The common theme betwixt all the
products was that they had no label. There was no ingredient list, no
trademark, no name. There was only a price, sometimes in a starburst in
the corner, and the decorative colors.</p>
      <p>Everyone loved this Isle. My friends would rave about it. The
products changed their lives. The products made them feel complete and
whole. The products were like paradise. This they said with funny,
stiff grins and unblinking and dry eyes. These people had turned into
TV characters waiting for the canned audience response before they
continued.</p>
      <p>Still, it was intriguing. There was no ad campaign at all.
Suddenly, in the center of the store, there was an Isle made up
entirely of unmarked products. At first, I'm sure, people thought they
were marked down versions of the real products. I'm sure that most of
the patrons thought these were rejects and that they were getting a
deal. That is probably why they thought these things were so great to
begin with. They expected the sinner, but <a href="isle-3.html"

 onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;">they bought the Savior</a>.</p>
