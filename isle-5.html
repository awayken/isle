swallowed. Then her right hand came around and went into the wound. It
appeared that she was trying to pull something out. As her hand
struggled out of the whole, she was lifting out another arm. In fact,
it was an entirely new copy of herself, dressed in entirely the same
clothing. She clamored out, smiling and happy, and took hold of the
other body, which was still moving. She kissed herself on the forehead,
then she picked herself up and walked into the bathroom. There was
silence in the room. I felt very sick.</p>

screaming and struggling. It stopped. Then there were sounds of running
water and air drying of hands. Out of the bathroom came the copy,
whistling. "I feel like a million bucks" she said as she walked past
me. There were stains of blood on her hands and her face. I didn't want
to know what she had done.</p>

was so literal. These people were being born again. The price of being
born again is the death of what you were. As I ran down the hall to the
front door, I could hear the singing grow louder in a host of voices. I
could picture what these people would do when they stopped screaming.</p>
