Curiousity was taking over. I finally broke at a large gathering of
co-workers. There had been gifts exchanged for whatever holiday or
event it had been. I was thinking of leaving, and was walking towards
the elevator when I heard a cheer. Someone had bought four bags of
unmarked potatoe chips. Each bag had 10 or 15 pills each, far more than
enough for the crowd, myself included. I walked back over.</p>

      <td colspan="2">
      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">People were calmy taking one pill
each and going in the lobby to sit. I took one and walked down to the
lobby with it in my hand. There was silence. Everyone sat where they
could, or had laid down, and had begun making that same low frequency
singing and giggling. I watched as smiles stayed firmly upon their
faces. People were actually smiling.</p>
      <p>It had been years since I had smiled. I wanted to smile very
badly at that moment. I wanted to more than anything. I placed the pill
in my mouth. I heard a sound, a ripping. I swallowed. The sound was
coming from one of the people in the lobby. She started singing louder
and louder; her mouth was trying to open wider to sing, but her jaw was
clenched tight.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Suddenly she screamed and arched her
back. She threw her arms out at the sides, hitting some people next to
her, and I saw her make tight fists at the end. Then, in a quick
movement, she brought her hands to her stomach, dug her fingers into
the skin, and pulled. The skin tore up to her solar plexis and down to
below her belt, and she relaxed as if she had released all that
threatened to tear her before. There was no blood, but steam started to
rise from the hole in her body. From where I stood I couldn't make out
any internal organs or bones or muscles, but I could <a
