 style="font-size: 40px; color: green;">had seen what</span> the Savior
looked like. I was at a friend's house, dining, and after the meal he
pulled out an unmarked Pepsi can. He opened in and then held it with
the mouth down and the bottom of the can up. No liquid came out,
instead a tiny pill landed on the table top. He took the pill in his
palm, slapped the palm to his mouth, tilted his head back, and
swallowed it down. He closed his eyes for a long ten seconds and then
opened them again.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 15px;">He offered me one that night. I took
it and didn't open it. It had the same weight as a can of soda. You
could hear the soda inside, if you shook it, and the can perspired as
if there were liquid inside. I soon departed, thanking my friend for
the gift, but complaining of being very tired. I'm not sure that he
heard me. He had begun to sing at a very, very low frequency and to
giggle from time to time while watching his wall clock. He didn't
notice me leave.</p>
      <p>Now here I was in the Isle again. Staring at the products that
everyone buys. Some people don't even buy food anymore. They walk
straight to Paradise Isle, take the closest product, and pay for it on
their way out. These are people who haven't seen a thought since the
day they discovered Paradise. These are people whose families have
broken over this pill. Then the family starts to use, and they aren't
broken anymore. <a href="isle-4.html" title="Addicts.  Losers."
